Python bindings for the Tianyan quantum cloud platform client.

This package provides synchronous access to the Tianyan quantum computing
cloud platform, allowing users to:

- Authenticate with API keys
- Discover available quantum backends
- Submit quantum circuits (QCIS format)
- Retrieve execution results with readout error mitigation

All blocking operations release the GIL, making the library safe for use
in multi-threaded Python applications.

Example:
    >>> from cqlib_tianyan import TianyanPlatform, TianyanError
    >>> platform = TianyanPlatform.login("your_api_key")
    >>> backends = platform.list_backends()
    >>> for b in backends:
    ...     print(f"{b.name}: {b.status}")
